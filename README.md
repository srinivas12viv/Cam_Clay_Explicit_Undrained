# Cam_Clay_Explicit_Undrained

MCC_Explicit_mono code is to run an undrained monotonic test for given preconsolidation pressure and current mean confining stress.
Typical input lines in the code look like:

This program is for predicting soil's behavior using MCC model in a Undrained TRIAXIAL TEST <br />
Enter the maximum Isotropic consolidation stress (Po')(kPa):392 <br />
Please define the initial stress state in p-q space- <br />
Enter the initial mean effective confining stress on the sample (kPa):305 <br />
